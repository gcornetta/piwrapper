# Fab Lab Modules: Machine Wrapper

This software is part of a larger suite of microservices designed to remotely manage digital fabrication equipment in a loosely coupled and distributed environment. More specifically, the software in this repo provides a software abstraction layer for 3D printers, laser cutters, vinyl cutters and desktop milling machines and exposes them over the internet as web services that can be consumed through REST APIs.
